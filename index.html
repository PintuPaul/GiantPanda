        <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

        <p>
            The giant panda also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.
        </p>

        <p>
            It characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
        </p>

        <p>
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves
            making up
            more than 99% of its diet.
        </p>

        <p>
            Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of
            birds,
            rodents, or carrion.
        </p>

        <p>
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with
            specially
            prepared food.
