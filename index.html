    <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

    <p>
        The giant panda also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.
    </p>

    <p>
        It characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
    </p>

    <p>
        The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up
        more than 99% of its diet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds,
        rodents, or carrion.
    </p>

    <p>
        In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially
        prepared food.
